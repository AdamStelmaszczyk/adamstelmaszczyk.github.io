I'm a research and teaching assistant at Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology, Institute of Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence Division.

## Research interests

- Optimization
  - Evolutionary algorithms
  - Search algorithms ([Game Tree Search Algorithms library](https://github.com/AdamStelmaszczyk/gtsa))
- Machine learning
  - Reinforcement learning
  - Neural networks
- Game theory

## Research ideas

1. "On the shoulders of giants". Get inspired from works of e.g.:

   David Silver, Timothy Lillicrap, Doina Precup, Richard Sutton, Jürgen Schmidhuber, Sepp Hochreiter, David Ha, John Schulman, Chelsea Finn, Sergey Levine, Volodymyr Mnih, Jonathan Schaeffer, Benjamin Recht

2. "Alternative ways of training neural nets". E.g. neuroevolution:

   2017 OpenAI _Evolution Strategies as a Scalable Alternative to Reinforcement Learning_  
   2017 Uber _Deep Neuroevolution: Genetic Algorithms Are a Competitive Alternative for Training Deep Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning_   
   2021 Dariusz Jagodziński _Deep Neuroevolution: Training Neural Networks Using a Matrix-Free Evolution Strategy_

3. "See how current AI is different from humans and imitate that". Examples:
  
   - Babies learn a lot unsupervised by playing and exploring on their own.
   - The human brain can repair.
   - Only chosen connections in the brain are strenghten.
   - Newborn brain is not initiated with something random.
  
   A paper listing those differences would be also great.
