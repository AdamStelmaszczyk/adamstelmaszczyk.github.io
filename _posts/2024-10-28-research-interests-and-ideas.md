## Research interests

Roughly in order of mine familiarity:

- Optimization
  - Search algorithms ([mine Game Tree Search Algorithms library](https://github.com/AdamStelmaszczyk/gtsa))
  - Heuristic & metaheuristic algorithms
- Machine learning
  - Reinforcement learning
  - Neural networks
- AI safety
- Game theory

## Research ideas / directions

1. "On the shoulders of giants". Study the work and get inspired from e.g.:

   David Silver, Timothy Lillicrap, Doina Precup, Richard Sutton, 
   Jürgen Schmidhuber, Sepp Hochreiter, 
   John Schulman, Chelsea Flynn, Sergey Levine, Volodymyr Mnih, 
   Jonathan Schaeffer

2. "Different ways of training neural nets". Improving the gradient methods, or non-gradient ones, e.g. neuroevolution.

   Neuroevolution papers:

   2017 OpenAI _Evolution Strategies as a Scalable Alternative to Reinforcement Learning_  
   2017 Uber _Deep Neuroevolution: Genetic Algorithms Are a Competitive Alternative for     Training Deep Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning_  
   2021 Nature _Correspondence between neuroevolution and gradient descent_ ❤️

   TODO: read 2021 "Deep Neuroevolution: Training Neural Networks Using a Matrix-Free Evolution Strategy", but need a PDF.

3. "There is model-based reinforcement learning, so let's do model-based evolution strategies".
Building an approximate model during the evolutionary search, e.g. to have a faster/cheaper simulator.

4. "Higher abstraction layer". From the lowest one in AI we have: the hardware,
programming languages, machine learning... maybe we could add something useful on top?
Go more meta / general? Maybe not fitting one function with some data, but perhaps...
multiple functions / architectures / algorithms... Or we could focus more on the data part, e.g. AI finding out which data needs or using it more efficiently.

6. Study metaheuristics from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_metaheuristics#cite_note-101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_metaheuristics#cite_note-101).
